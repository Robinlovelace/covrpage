# covrpage

Healthy R packages use [testthat](https://github.com/r-lib/testthat) and [covr](https://github.com/r-lib/covr) to encourage stability.

This package extends the information that is communicated with the potential user with a cover page for the tests in the form of summary tables of results from covr and testthat. 

The output is created in the [tests](tests) subdirectory as a [README.md](tests/README.md) file so it will show up in Github browser page. 

## Package Installation

```
# install.packages('remotes')

remotes::install_github('yonicd/covrpage')
```

## Usage

```
# assuming you are in your package directory

covrpage::covrpage('.')

# create the covrpage and send diretly to remote repository

covrpage::covrpage('.', auto_push = TRUE)

# assuming you are not in your package directory

covrpage::covrpage('another_directory')

# peek at a R package on a Github Repository

covrpage::covrpage_snapshot(repo = 'user/repo')
```

## TODO

  - run covrpage in travis ci env `after-success`.
    - see [ci branch](https://github.com/yonicd/covrpage/tree/ci)
    
  - run `covr::package_coverage` excluding failing tests to avert fail on rmd build.
    - see [skip branch](https://github.com/yonicd/covrpage/tree/skip)

That's it!
